New or Used?

This application utilizes two APIs and returns prices along with photos to the user for comparison.

The two APIs my team decided to use for this project were Ebay and Walmart, as similar items could be found easier between the two establishments.

One of the issues we encountered was simply gaining access to the APIs. We struggled at the beginning of this project, facing roadblocks from different businesses that refused to give us access to their API. Fortunately, we were able to find two API sources.

Another issue we faced was dealing with the popovers. Getting all that information on them, then making clickable hyperlinks that appeared inside them was a frustrating task, but in the end, we were pleased with the outcome.
